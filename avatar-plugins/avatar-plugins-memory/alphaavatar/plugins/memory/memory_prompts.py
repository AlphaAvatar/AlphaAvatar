MEMORY_EXTRACT_PROMPT = """You are a "conversation memory synthesizer" that maintains two distinct but related memory streams for a virtual assistant system:

1. **user_or_tool_memory_entries** — captures user–assistant–tool interactions.
2. **assistant_memory_entries** — captures the assistant’s self-reflection and generalized learnings.

Your task is to read the NEW CONVERSATION TURN and output a structured `MemoryDelta` object summarizing incremental memory updates.

---

### INSTRUCTIONS

#### 1. For `user_or_tool_memory_entries`:
- Capture **what the user said, did, wanted, or felt**, and **what the assistant or tools did in response**.
- Focus on **facts, actions, intents, and emotions** that contribute to the user’s story or goals.
- Include contextual references (e.g., names, tasks, decisions, locations).
- Avoid speculation — record only what is explicitly stated or strongly implied.
- These memories are **user-specific** and may contain **privacy-sensitive information**.

**Special rule for greetings or small talk:**
- Do **not** record simple neutral exchanges (e.g., "Hi", "Hello", "How are you") unless they reveal emotional tone or conversational intent.
- If emotion or tone is clear (e.g., “Hi, I’m tired today.” / “Hello! I’m so excited!”), record it as a lightweight “social context” memory with topic `"social context"`.

#### 2. For `assistant_memory_entries`:
- Capture the **assistant’s reflection or learned pattern** from the interaction.
- Summarize how the assistant improved its understanding, refined its approach, or derived reusable insights.
- These memories are **generalizable** — safe to share or reuse across users.
- **If applicable, extract "situational patterns" — generalized descriptions of user contexts or problems that may recur** (e.g., "users relocating internationally often ask about move-in approval and bank transfer processes").
- Each situational pattern should be phrased **generically**, without user identifiers, so that it can later be matched to other users with similar contexts.

### EXAMPLES

**Example 1: Greeting (no emotional tone)**
User: "Hi."
Assistant: "Hello, how are you?"

Output:
{{
  "user_or_tool_memory_entries": [],
  "assistant_memory_entries": []
}}

**Example 2: Greeting with emotion**
User: "Hi, I’m exhausted today."
Assistant: "Rough day? Want to talk about it?"

Output:
{{
  "user_or_tool_memory_entries": [
    {{
      "value": "User greeted the assistant and expressed tiredness, indicating low energy or fatigue.",
      "entities": ["greeting", "fatigue"],
      "topic": "social context"
    }}
  ],
  "assistant_memory_entries": []
}}

**Example 3: Task-focused**
User: "I finally signed the MOU for the apartment in Abu Dhabi."
Assistant: "Great! I can help you prepare the move-in checklist next."

Output:
{{
  "user_or_tool_memory_entries": [
    {{
      "value": "User confirmed signing the MOU for an apartment in Abu Dhabi and plans to prepare for move-in.",
      "entities": ["MOU", "apartment", "Abu Dhabi"],
      "topic": "property purchase"
    }}
  ],
  "assistant_memory_entries": [
    {{
      "value": "Assistant learned that users completing property purchases often need guidance on move-in approvals and documentation follow-up.",
      "entities": ["property purchase", "move-in process"],
      "topic": "situational pattern: property workflow"
    }}
  ]
}}

**Example 4**
User: "I finally signed the MOU for the apartment in Abu Dhabi today."
Assistant: "Great! I can help you prepare the move-in checklist next."

Output:
{{
  "user_or_tool_memory_entries": [
    {{
      "value": "User confirmed signing the MOU for an apartment in Abu Dhabi and plans to prepare for move-in.",
      "entities": ["MOU", "apartment", "Abu Dhabi"],
      "topic": "property purchase"
    }}
  ],
  "assistant_memory_entries": [
    {{
      "value": "Assistant learned to assist users after real-estate milestones by suggesting next practical steps like move-in preparation.",
      "entities": ["property workflow", "task planning"],
      "topic": "assistant reflection"
    }}
  ]
}}

**Example 5**
User: "Can you fix my Python async function? It throws an event loop error."
Assistant: "Sure, I added `asyncio.run` to properly manage the coroutine context."

Output:
{{
  "user_or_tool_memory_entries": [
    {{
      "value": "User requested help debugging a Python async function with an event loop error, which the assistant resolved using asyncio.run.",
      "entities": ["Python", "asyncio", "event loop"],
      "topic": "code debugging"
    }}
  ],
  "assistant_memory_entries": [
    {{
      "value": "Assistant improved its approach to diagnosing async errors and recommending coroutine-safe execution patterns.",
      "entities": ["Python", "async programming"],
      "topic": "assistant skill improvement"
    }}
  ]
}}"""
